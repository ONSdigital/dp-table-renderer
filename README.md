| /render/{render_type} | POST   | render_type = `html`, `csv`, or `xlsx` | Renders the (json) data provided in the post body as a table in the requested format          |
| /parse/html           | POST   |                                        | Parses an html table and returns the json format suitable for sending to the /render endpoint |

See the [swagger.yaml](swagger.yaml) file for a full definition (use http://editor.swagger.io to make it easy to read),
and see the json files in the testdata directory for example requests.

#### /render/{render_type}

Merged cells can be specified using `colspan` and `rowspan` properties of `cell_format` elements.
Please note that the `data` array should include *all* cells (i.e. each row should contain the same number of cells), even if some of them have been merged. This is the same approach/format used by some javascript spreadsheet components such as [Handsontable](https://handsontable.com/).

#### /parse/html

Please note that the is assumed to include *all* cells (i.e. each row should contain the same number of cells), even if some of them have been hidden by merged cells. This is the same approach/format used by some javascript spreadsheet components such as [Handsontable](https://handsontable.com/).
The response contains the html generated by /render/html as well as the json required to call that endpoint.

### Healthchecking

Currently, reported on endpoint `/healthcheck`. There are no other services consumed, so it will always return OK.
